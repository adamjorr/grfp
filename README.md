These are my submissions for the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program.

Due to a rule change, graduate students are now allowed to apply only once for the fellowship.
However, my cohort was grandfathered in and allowed to submit in both the first and second year of graduate school.
I hope this can be a resource for anyone applying to the program.

## Results
 * **2016** - Not awarded
 * **2017** - Honorable Mention

## 2016

My 2016 submission and scores can be found in the 2016 folder.

I didn't use a version control system while drafting my statements in 2016.
As a guess, once my statements were completely drafted I went through 10-12 rounds of revision.
The submitted version was the one used to initialize the repository.

## 2017

My 2017 submission and scores can be found in the 2017 folder.

For my 2017 submission, I started with my 2016 submission and iterated based on feedback from the reviews and feedback from others.
There are 15-16 writing related commits, so probably another 8-10 revisions from my 2016 submission.
